## [1.3.0] - 1.2.2024

### Important Change
Important for customers with custom content elements: We are now using the [CSP Distribution of Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/advanced/csp). Thus, developers my no longer use any inline JavaScript in HTML/TWIG files associated with Alpine. Instead, there must always be a reference pointing to an associated alpine data object. We changed the implementation of a couple of components to comply with this new rule. The advantage of it is that content elements using Alpine.js are now shown properly in the 'Preview' mode of the content editor and in live mode without having to change the CSP settings. By using the CSP distribution of Alpine.js, it is no longer required to add `usafe-eval` to the CSP, which helps to increase security (#355743). Developers might have to adapt their components to comply with this new rule. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this change, reach out to your BSI contact to get more information.
